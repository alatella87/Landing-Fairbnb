# landing_fbnb

Fairbnb Landing Page (please update changes made here)
LATEST CHANGE : 24/03/2017

# Assets folders

The assets folders contains all the Mobirise templating engine elements (bootstrap, formoid, smooth-scroll, tether, etc.). It shouldn't be necessary deleting/modifying the majority of these files. 

# Changing the Landing Page 

New sections can be be added, and existing sections can be modified using the main css stylesheet under assets>theme>css>style.css.

#Formoid (formoid.net)

The Landing page can be changed in the index.html file. As the subscription relies on a formoid.net plugin that is embedded within the Mobirise templating engine, it is recommended to leave unchanged the lines 71-103 starting with <section class="mbr-section"...>

#Manifesto 

The current Manifesto (old version) is hosted on the main server (/fairManif.pdf)
